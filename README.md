# Policy Innovation Lab Plays

## 1. Trust the process. 

When you have worked in government for so long, it can feel uncomfortable at first to experience an entirely new way of working. Lean into it. Human-centered design and agile require a shift in mindset. You may find that students needed to pivot from the original project brief after discovering through talking with constituents that they have different needs than you originally thought. That's ok. This reframe can not only lead to solving real problems for constituents but also working more nimbly and using resources more efficiently and effectively. 

**Frame the problem you want to solve through the point of view of the constituent.**

As you create a project brief for Policy Innovation Lab, put yourself in the shoes of the constituents impacted by your project. Having a constituent-centric mindset will get you on the same page as the students and ultimately create projects that have greater impact.

**Be open to user research.**

Students need to do user research activities, like interviewing and prototype testing, in order to practice human-centered design. User research will also lead to greater impact. As you develop your project brief for Policy Innovation Lab, ask various stakeholders if it would be ok if students reached out to you during the semester. Also be open to students utilizing or developing their own contacts for user research.

**Needs are verbs; solutions are nouns.
 
As you create a project brief for Policy Innovation Lab, start with understanding what your constituents need. If you think about these needs as verbs instead of nouns (e.g., "I need to escape the rain" instead of "I need an umbrella), you will open up the realm of possibility for what students can create as solutions that serve real needs. 

## 2. Set expectations with your client early and keep the process transparent. 

Being on the same page with the client about what they expect and what we can deliver is crucial. A lot of time and effort can be wasted if the group is working under different assumptions than the client. 

**Keep checking in with client as project evolves**

Your project will probably change over time, be sure to keep your client in the loop as it does. This sets clear expectations for both of you and allows you to incorporate their feedback on every iteration, instead of surprising them at the end with a product they do not want or need. 

**Understand the difference between your client and your end-user**

Your client is likely asking you to create something that they can then take to distribute to a third party. Understand that your client may not actually know exactly what the end user is looking for. Push to talk to end users and understand their needs. Clients ultimately want to deliver something with utility and so it’s in your best interest to really make something users will benefit from. 

**Dedicate one main client contact**

This will usually be the PM, but its important to have one group member be the client contact for the entire group. This streamlines client communication and cuts down on possible confusion and client annoyance (this can happen if the client is getting multiple emails from multiple people telling them the same thing, or worse, different things!).

## 3. Embrace openness and the technology tools of the class

At first, you can think using a public Trello board and Slack is odd. However, as we prepare to be policymakers and civil servants, it's important to get comfortable with transparency about the process (since taxpayers are entrusting us to make decisions on their behalf). Also, these are pretty cool tools to learn.

Keep prototyping and prepare client facing documents with a lot of check out. Know from the beginning all your materials and organizing channels are going to be available to professors, clients, and Team PA. Getting your mind around this early can think about how best to communicate and organize documents and organizing tools.

## 4. Set team protocols, expectations, and roles early. Stick to them. 

This should be completed very early on. In addition, Retros should be used to continue to work on these expectations.  If your team is going to use Slack, then stick to it. If your team plans to use email, then use email. Ensure each team member is receiving the communications and can stay in the loop.  

Though sometimes roles make people feel like they’re pigeonholed into doing one type of work, they’re incredibly important for delegation and assigning responsibility. It’s simply more efficient. This doesn’t mean that that person has to do all the heavy lifting of that role (the Research lead doesn’t have to do all the research). Instead they are responsible for making sure the work is delivered on time every week. On the flip side, roles don’t mean you are free to turn down other types of work that don’t fall into your “lane.” Everyone should be an individual contributor for an even number of tasks.

Makes sure that your group sits down as soon as possible and establish who will do what; you will want a project manager at the very least. This will help everyone focus on what their strengths are and make sure that no one is duplicating efforts. It also helps team moral as everyone will know what they need to do.

## 5. Maintain a common plan and update your teammates regularly. 

**Assign "owners" of deliverables and stick to them**

This class can have a lot of deliverables (both client-facing and non-client-facing) depending on your client and what the final work product is. Making sure you know who is responsible for what will make turning in deliverables and getting things done much easier.

**Assign work to individuals and set intermittent deadlines.**

Clear tasks and deadlines for individuals can make the process more organized, especially for large groups. You can also avoid situations where tasks are not completed until the last minute or not at all because there was no clear owner.

**Establish accountability**

Summary: Developing and ensuring continued trust among team members is essential.  A well-established team structure, no matter the size, is crucial for effective collaboration.  This does not necessarily need to be specific roles for everyone, but encouraging cross-functionality while outlining certain responsibilities will foster a more rewarding experience.

**Maintain reasonably frequent communication with other team members.** 

Between other obligations and busy schedules, try to touch base with other team members frequently outside of class to ensure you are not recreating work or miscommunicating. This will ensure you are ready to speak with your client or share updates when asked in class. 

## 6. Don’t be afraid to scrap a potential deliverable if it no longer makes sense. 

These fast-moving projects mean you often must start prototyping before you have a full enough picture of the issue. This means that you may have to rethink your deliverable part-way through and that is fine. 

**Defining failure criteria is equally as important as determining success criteria.**

Summary: This course is process-driven.  Process requires learning from mistakes and pivoting.  This process is motivated by the agile methodology that necessitates determining acceptance criteria for various project phases.  The same should be done with failure criteria. It’s important to learn how to fail well; knowing when to walk away and what to learn from those failures.

## 7. Strive to find the balance between scope and impact. 

It is very easy to pursue projects that are low impact with a manageable scope or that have high impact but an unrealistic scope. It is vital to identify a deliverable that has a manageable scope with a moderate to high impact. 

Be realistic about what you can complete in the time frame that will be most impactful and get client feedback. With scoping as you work toward your final deliverable keep a master document that has all the information so you have a nice organized document of what was accomplished and what is left to do to hand off to the client.

## 8. Develop a flexible, iterative timeline early

The weeks will fly by being able to look ahead and think about what is happening the following week can help you more effectively manage your time. Make sure you know the progress and the steps in the process and map out deliverable due dates so that you can ensure you are meeting them. That means checking syllabus and working with professor and client, so you know what deliverables they are expecting throughout the semester. Read up on Scrum and Agile methods so you know what to expect and assign roles to complete task.

**Learn to pivot.**

There's inevitably going to be a client meeting or interview or article that you read that makes you think you're trending in the wrong direction (it might even be week 4). But it's okay to pivot (strategically). All the work you did wasn't for not.

**Be flexible and comfortable with change.** 

As you continue to develop your project and engage in user research, what you thought you had in mind of your end deliverable will constantly evolve and change - and this is OK!

**Be comfortable with change, even if it means starting over.**

The initial understanding of the project can change quickly, either through interactions with the client or through user interviews. Be prepared to adapt your materials to meet new needs. All progress is good progress, and will help create a strong product in the end.

## 9. Embrace user research and what it means. Keep your plan user-centric so that any pivots stem from user needs. 

**Keep testing and interviewing.**

It's never too late to do a user interview. The class length is short, and some interviewees may not reveal themselves until the end. Even if they do not directly impact the direction of your project, the information gained will still be valuable for the client and could influence the next stages.

More often than not, projects will be non-linear. Keep moving forward. 

Each time you receive more information use this as a chance to enhance or potentially recreate your product. Learning more from your client will help shape how you continue your work, even if this means pivoting to a new direction. 

## 10. Stay focused on the problem you're trying to solve.

**Encourage teams, users, and facilitators to keep more options on the table.**

Oftentimes project teams, clients, and stakeholders get entrenched in their respective ideas for what the final outcome should be.  Being able to reconcile “ideal outcomes” with prototypes and minimum viable products throughout the agile process is essential for success.  Tons of research exists on the value of assessing multiple alternatives before making decisions. If all invested parties can consider more options throughout the duration of the project, collaborative output will likely be more productive and of higher quality.
